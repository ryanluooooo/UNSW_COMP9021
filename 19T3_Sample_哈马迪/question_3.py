    >>> f(2)
    The decomposition of 2 into prime factors reads:
       2 = 2
    >>> f(3)
    The decomposition of 3 into prime factors reads:
       3 = 3
    >>> f(4)
    The decomposition of 4 into prime factors reads:
       4 = 2^2
    >>> f(5)
    The decomposition of 5 into prime factors reads:
       5 = 5
    >>> f(6)
    The decomposition of 6 into prime factors reads:
       6 = 2 x 3
    >>> f(8)
    The decomposition of 8 into prime factors reads:
       8 = 2^3
    >>> f(10)
    The decomposition of 10 into prime factors reads:
       10 = 2 x 5
    >>> f(15)
    The decomposition of 15 into prime factors reads:
       15 = 3 x 5
    >>> f(100)
    The decomposition of 100 into prime factors reads:
       100 = 2^2 x 5^2
    >>> f(5432)
    The decomposition of 5432 into prime factors reads:
       5432 = 2^3 x 7 x 97
    >>> f(45103)
    The decomposition of 45103 into prime factors reads:
       45103 = 23 x 37 x 53
    >>> f(45100)
    The decomposition of 45100 into prime factors reads:
       45100 = 2^2 x 5^2 x 11 x 41
