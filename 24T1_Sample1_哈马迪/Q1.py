'''
Complete the code in the function that, given a list L of random non negative whole numbers, 
decomposes L into a list R of increasing sequences and with consecutive duplicates removed.

        with consecutive duplicates removed, is:

        with consecutive duplicates removed, is:

        with consecutive duplicates removed, is:

    >>> f(0, 3, 10)
    Here is L: [6, 6, 0]
